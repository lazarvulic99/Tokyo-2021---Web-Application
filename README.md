# Tokyo-2021---Web-Application

Web app made for Tokyo 2021 Olympics Game.

There are 3 types of user accounts: organizer, team leader and delegate. You can add all of them.

Organizer accepts sports that can be played at Olympics if there is enough number of players. Organizer can create competition, for both, male and female players, and accept national teams and individual players to participate in the competition. One player can participate in more than one discipline, but in only one sport. Organizer can see all-time records in every discipline of competition.

The team leader can add players for his representation, that means from country from where he is from. He can also create teams for group sports and discipline. Only players from same sport and same discipline can be added to one team. A list of all national players can be shown to the national team leader. You can search by multiple parameters through the list.

The delegate can add dates and times for every match or race in the competition, and also can write the particular results down. There are disciplines that have only one round, but also disciplines that can have multiple rounds. The delegate can't import results for another round, if the previous round hasn't been finished. The delegate also finishes the competitions and rewards players or representations with appropriate medals. Players with medals(gold, silver, bronze) can be shown in the falling list of rewarded players. Countries can be sort by total of medals, or by number of golden medals, then silver medals and bronze medals.

A list of all players, with the possibility of search by name, surname, sport, sport discipline, country name and whether he/she is rewarded with medal, can be listed to all users. All users can see total number of participating players from every country with small flag included in the graphics.
